ETL Application Read Me

Overview:

Welcome to the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Application! This powerful tool is designed to streamline your
data processing needs, from extracting data from various sources to transforming it into a clean and usable format, 
and finally loading it into your preferred destination.

Getting Started:

    Configuration File:
        To begin, create a configuration file that contains all the necessary details and information 
        for your ETL job. For a quick start, you can use the provided demo configuration CSV file.

    Upload to Dropbox:
        Upload your configuration file to Dropbox. This will serve as the bridge between your local setup and the ETL application.

    Application Setup:
        Once the configuration file is in Dropbox, the application will automatically detect and read the configurations. 
        This includes information about data sources, transformation steps, and destination settings.

ETL Workflow:

    Extraction:
        The application supports data extraction from a variety of sources, including Excel, CSV, delimited files, JSON, SQL databases
        (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and cloud services (AWS).

    Transformation:
        After extracting datasets, the application initiates transformations such as removing duplicates, 
        handling null values, and formatting data types. These steps ensure that your data is clean and ready for analysis.

    Loading:
        Once the transformation is complete, the application dynamically loads the dataset into the specified destination.
        Supported destinations include Excel, CSV, delimited files, SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and cloud services (AWS).

Usage Instructions:

    Demo Configuration File:
        Download the provided demo configuration CSV file for a better understanding of the required structure.

    Upload Configuration:
        Upload your custom configuration file to Dropbox to configure the ETL process.

    Review Data Changes:
        The application will display changes to the dataset in real-time, allowing you to review and confirm that the transformation
        meets your expectations.

    Load Data:
        When satisfied with the dataset, click on the "Load Data" button to store it in the specified destination.
